# Energiency Big Data Project
Course Work ENSAI

The objective of the project is to predict the failure of machines to enable energy management in
manufacturing industries. This helps in the planning of industrial tasks to improve energy
management. The project has been executed by statistical analysis of large amounts of machine
data collected from French industries over the past two years. Results obtained from statistical
analysis will help the industries in reducing undesirable machine stoppages during manufacturing.
Data including energy consumption, production, and maintenance planning are considered for
the analysis, and the probability of machine failure for the following days is analyzed.
