# Linear-Data-Regression-DAT21 
# Kaggle Competition

Objective : 

The project is aimed at the implementation of a case study in linear regression (‘DAT21 Linear
Regression Assignment’), published on the kaggle website. Machine learning techniques learnt during the
lecture on ‘Python for Data Science’at ENSAI were utilized to implement the case study. Training and
testing datasets from the kaggle website were used to implement the project. We used IPython Notebook
as the primary tool to implement and test our code. Mean Absolute Error (MAE) results obtained using
different machine learning models were tested on the kaggle website and final scores were reported.
We have discussed our problem solving methodology and MAE scores obtained in the subsequent
sections.
